/*
A string is called balanced when every letter occurring in the string, appears both in upper-and lowercase. For example, the string "CATattac" is balanced ('a', 'c'and T occur in both cases), but "Madam" is not ('d' and 'a' appear only in lowercase). 

Examples: 1. Given S = 'azABaabza", the function should return 5. The shortest balanced fragment of Sis "ABaab". 
2. Given S = 'TacoCat", the function should return-1. There is no balanced fragment. 
3. Given S = "AcZcbaBz", the function should return 8. The shortest balanced fragment is the whole string. 
4. Given S = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", the function should return -1. 
string S consists only of letters ('a'-'Z' and/or A - Z).
